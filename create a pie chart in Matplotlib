#we conducted a survey of 100 people to find out their favorite genres of music. The results were as follows:

Pop: 40%
Rock: 30%
Hip-hop: 15%
Country: 10%
Other: 5%

using Matplotlib


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Generate The Data
labels = ['Pop', 'Rock', 'Hip-hop', 'Country','Other']
sizes = [40, 30, 15, 10, 5]

# crate a pie chart
plt.pie(sizes, labels=labels, startangle=90, autopct='%.1f%%') # autopct - (to show the percentages on each slice)
                                                               # startangle - (to set the starting angle of the chart).

# Add title
plt.title('favorite genres of music')

# Show plot
plt.show() # to display the pie chart in a new window
